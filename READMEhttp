This package includes one c code file which generates a tcp client connection.
Using the server of the URI and a text file given through the
command line, the client requests data from the server site, byte by byte, which
creates a file of the given name, and writes to the file an image, html, etc.. 
There is constant error checking at each stage of the program. The client
has a protocol to quit when the data transfer is complete.

httpclient.c
The client creates a socket connection with the server, sends a get request, and receives data
byte by byte, writing everything after the header into a file.

Makefile
This file compiles httpclient.c by the call make, and also allows for the
call make clean to remove .o files, however there is no run command as there are command
line arguments of the URI and file name required.
