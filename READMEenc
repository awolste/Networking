This package includes two c code files which encrypt and decript any combination
of characters by using an xor bitwise fucntion. These files also only include
open, read and write unix functions instead of print and scan, in order to show
a proficiency in using a buffer. To catch the EOF, when ran on mac, you must type
your characters to be encrypted, then hit Enter then Ctrl + D. The other option is
hit you must type your characters to be encrypted, then Ctrl + D twice.

encryption.c
This program takes a text file name, a key, and any amount of characters and
creates or opens this file then writes the XOR'd version of the characters
to the desired text file.

decryption.c
This program takes a text file name which already exists and is encrypted, the same
key used in the first step, reads the file and writes the XOR'd version of the
characters to the standard outpit.
