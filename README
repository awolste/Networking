This package includes two c code files which generate a udp client/server connection.
Using the server ip address, a port number, and a text file given through the
command line, the client communicates data to the server program, line by line, which
creates a file of the same name, reverses the order of each line, and writes to the
file. There is constant error checking at each stage of the program. The client and
server have a protocol to quit when the data transfer is complete

client.c
The client creates a socket connection with the server using an ip address and port
number, and sends line by line the contents of the file given by the command line,
then quits.

server.c
The server creates a file, binds to an address, then calls recvfrom to wait for a 
message from the client, at which time it creates a file with the file name give, then 
loops infinitely, reversing and writing each line recieved to the file, then quits 
when EOF is sent.

Makefile
This file compiles server.c and client.c by the call make, and also allows for the
call make clean to remove .o files, however there is no run command as they must be
run seperately on different terminals to create a connection.
