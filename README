This package includes one c code file which generates a connection that can be used to chat concurrently with
multiple computers at once. Using standard in the user can initiate a connection to an ip address, send a
message to a specific computer, and close a specific connection. The program can also receive messages from
other computers by the use of multiplexing and threading.

lastprogram.c
This tpc client and server creates a socket, binds and address to it, and listens for a connection request or 
command from the standard in. It utilizes a konnect function to create a connection to another ip,
keeps track of all the connections and can do any of the above commands with any computer at any time.
To initiate connection type i *IPaddress*, to send a message send s *IPaddress* *message*, to terminate a 
connection type x *IPaddress*, and to quit the program type q.

Makefile
This file compiles lastprogram.c by the call make, and also allows for the
call make clean to remove .o files, however there is no run command.
